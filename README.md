# Movie Trailer website

This code generates a web page with a number of selected movies. For each movie, the title, a poster image and a link to a youtube trailer is included. 

## Running the code

You have to have Python 3 installed for the code to function. You can run the `entertainment_center.py` file in the command line by issuing the `python entertainment_center.py` command. Note that you need to have the `fresh_tomatoes.py` and `media.py` files present in the project folder, as these modules are imported by the code.
